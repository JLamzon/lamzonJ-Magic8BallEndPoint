-Postman software - https://www.postman.com/

Use VSCode to open prgram. Click file -> Choose folder
Once open, on the top menu bar of VSCode: Click the dropdown “run” -> click “start debugging”.
A web browser will open with a port address, It will look like this: https://localhost:7000/
Note: you use this info in postman
Open postman, copy and paste the port address into Postman Get:  https://localhost:7000/
you can verify port by going to VSCode -> Debug Console -> Scroll up until you see “Now listening on port”
Add Input Controller Name -> Route Name -> user input.  Example: https://localhost:7000/CName/RName/UInput
